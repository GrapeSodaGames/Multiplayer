# Design Lens Questions
## LENS 001: The Lens of Emotion
### 1. What emotions would I like my player to experience?  Why?
- Excitement, because it comes from conflict and gives a more active role to the player if they are engaged
- Humor, because I like humor, and I think you can do more with it emotionally than just being grimdark.  Gives personality.
- Surprise, because I want the player to remember the experience.  They shouldn't be able to easily guess how it will go.
- Relaxation, because too much excitement burns you out.  Cycles of tension and release, just like music.
- Accomplishment, specifically of the collaborative type.  Working together effectively to overcome obstacles is very satisfying.
